		<h2>Elizabeth Jane Cole</h2>
		
		<p>Elizabeth Jane Cole cofounded <a href=http://eviltwinbooking.org/ target=_blank>Evil Twin Booking Agency</a>, which organizes idea-oriented
		   events with a focus on skill building and knowledge expansion.
		
		<p>Recently, she traveled across China and met with <a href=http://eviltwinbooking.org/news/ai-wei-wei-glenn-greenwald-yes-men-vandana-shiva-common/ target=_blank>Ai Wei Wei</a> , hackers, Tsinghua University
		   professors, and <a href=https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/File:HTTC2014SeeedStudio.jpg target=_blank>open source entrepreneurs</a>, with the goal of learning how to create
		   communities where people have support doing what they really love.
		
		<p>Combining her passion for science and the origins of life in the universe with her love of
		   dumpster diving, she builds <a href=http://eviltwinbooking.org/presentations/testing-testing-123/ target=_blank>open source PCR machines</a> and mobile biology labs from
		   recycled and scavenged materials.
		
		<p>For fun, she produces <a href=https://soundcloud.com/loveandradio/dirty-balloons-rebroadcast target=_blank>radio pieces</a> for <a href=http://www.radiotopia.fm/ target=_blank>Love + Radio</a>. She is a member of <a href=http://genspace.org/ target=_blank>Genspace</a>, New York
		   Cityâ€™s community bio lab. Her writing about DIY film, tech, and debauchery in the
		   man-machine continuum has been published in WIRED magazine, Filmmaker and other
		   outlets.
