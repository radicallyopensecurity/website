		<h2>Frouke van Ommeren</h2>
		
		<p>Frouke is a freelance content writer, composer (of books) and chief editor. She's got a
		   bachelor of journalism from hogeschool Windesheim, Zwolle.
		
		<p>Frouke has worked for government organizations as media-consultant, business journalist
		   and web editor. From 2011, she chose to work as a freelancer. In her professional life she is
		   committed to be independent. The enthusiasm and mutual appreciation between freelance
		   workers and clients is a great inspiration in her work as freelance editor.
		
		<p>Independence is also reflected in her travels. She loves to travel self-sufficient by foot or
		   bicycle. There is almost nothing more beautiful and more glorious as sleeping near a stream
		   in the middle of the Swedish mountains or the Scottish Highlands.
