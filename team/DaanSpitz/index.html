		<h2>Daan Spitz</h2>
		
		<p>I am a freelance programmer and security specialist from the Netherlands. I have a
		   background in software development and application-level security. My other interests lie in
		   the fields of operating systems, exploit development, and fuzzing & vulnerability discovery. I
		   have several years of experience in performing infrastructure and application-level
		   penetration tests.
		
		<p>I occasionally play CTF with the Eindbazen team which I enjoy a lot, and I'm currently
		   working as the lead developer on the NetAidKit project.
