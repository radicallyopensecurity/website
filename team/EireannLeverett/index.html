		<h2>Eireann Leverett</h2>
		
		<p>Eireann Leverett has studied psychology, philosophy, artificial
		   intelligence, software engineering, and computer security at various
		   times in his life. He holds a BEng from Edinburgh Univesity and an MPhil
		   from the University of Cambridge in Advanced Computer Science.

		<p>His MPhil thesis refuted the concept of the industrial airgap by finding
		   10K Industrial systems online, and working with CERT teams around the
		   world to understand the impact. He has over 10 years experience in
		   security and 15 years in software development.

		<p>His research focuses upon technological disasters and the economic
		   impacts of computer security failures or accidents. He has experience of
		   compromising the security of organisations (with permission), and
		   assisting them to improve their security postures through a variety of
		   short and long term methods. He is interested in computer security at
		   scale, security economics, systems security, incident response, critical
		   infrastructure protection, safety, firmware signing, exploit markets,
		   vulnerability management, quality assurance, indicators of compromise,
		   modelling, networks, risk, visualisations, and zero knowledge proofs. He
		   is a frequent public speaker on these subjects.

		<p>At Radically Open Security he is focussed on embedded devices,
		   industrial systems, SCADA/DMS/EMS, Smart Grids, or any computer system
		   that interacts with the real world. He performs network assesments,
		   device vulnerability assesments, embedded webserver testing, malware
		   analysis, and key management discussions and audits. He also likes to do
		   development of metrics and tools for defenders and cyber-insurance. He
		   has worked for the last year at the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies on
		   cyber-insurance and aggregation risk.
