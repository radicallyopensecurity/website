		<h2>Jane Chalaby</h2>
		
		<p>In an earlier life, Jane studied Fine Art and became an Art Historian working in Collections
		   Documentation for various institutions such as the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich,
		   and the Wellcome Collection, London. Jane holds a Masters Degree in the History of Art from
		   University College London. She has also worked at a major London auction house as a
		   Specialist, valuing and cataloguing antiques and collectables. Since the 2000s she has been a
		   Freelance Editor of academic books and papers.
		
		<p>Jane is a passionate advocate for Women in Tech and STEM and uses social media to share
		   knowledge and encourage take-up of digital skills, especially for those from a non-tech
		   background. Most recently, she has worked as a Teacher for Blueshift Coding, teaching a
		   group of primary school children how to code with Scratch.
		
		<p>Jane, a closet geek for most of her life, only found real happiness when she finally admitted
		   to herself that working in tech was what she most desired, so she set about studying
		   Computer Science subjects. Jane loves hardware and physical computing, and her next
		   challenge is to develop her understanding of networks and connectivity.
