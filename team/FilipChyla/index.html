		<h2>Filip Chyla</h2>
		
		<p>Disassembled my first computer at the age of 5, pulling stuff apart is fun, putting it back
		   together not included in the skill set. Disassembling applications make my brain hurt in a
		   good way.
		
		<p>Enjoy playing hacker war games, programming because I wanted to make my own game.
		
		<p>My motto:
		
		<p><q>You learn something new everyday and every key press might result in something
		   interesting happening.</q><br>
		   In my free time I enjoy playing video and board games. 
		
		<p>Currently working InfoSec on the defense, <q>man the walls, close the gates!</q>
