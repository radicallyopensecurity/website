		<h2>Mike Wessling</h2>
		
		<p>Mike Wessling has a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science and during his studies he wrote a
		   paper arguing against the use of firewalls, a new fangled idea proposed at the time by Steve
		   Bellovin in 1994. Although he has revised his opinion on firewalls he still believes that
		   security must be intrinsic in the design and operation of any IT service and not outsourced to
		   the crunchy shell of firewalls.
		
		<p>After his studies he has worked in many roles; from Helpdesk support at Pink Elephant, via
		   Network engineer and engineering manager at AT&amp;T to CTO at Bitbrains. After 20+ years
		   Mike is still fascinated by new ideas and developments.
		
		<p>Besides working with computers and nerds Mike can be found at festivals and fairs with his
		   flamethrowers and big mechanical transformers.
