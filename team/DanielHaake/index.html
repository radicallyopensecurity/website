		<h2>Daniel Haake</h2>
		
		<p>Daniel is a hacker and security enthusiast, but he would not say that he is a hacker. In his
		   opinion the term "hacker" is some kind of compliment and he is only a hacker if others call
		   him so. Independently of this he really likes it to participate in penetration tests and is a
		   passionate "capture the flag" participant. In 2014 he was one of the finalists who represented
		   Germany at the "European Cyber Security Challenge" where he and his team got the second
		   place. In 2015 he qualified for the finals of the "Cyber Security Challenge Germany" and
		   prevailed against over 800 other hackers. This year he also did some "live hacking"
		   presentation on the CeBIT 2015 in Hannover (Germany). His main focuses in information
		   security are WLAN and malware stuff.
