		<h2>Sake Blok</h2>
		
		<p>My interest in Networking was first raised when I started working for one of the first ISP's in
		   The Netherlands (back in 1995). My L2/L3 knowlegde was gathered while working for a large
		   bank. I then switched teams within that bank to manage their redundant internet gateway
		   based on a loadbalanced firewall cluster, loadbalancers, ssl-offloaders, caches and proxies.
		   In that time (2000) I started using Ethereal to troubleshoot problems within that
		   environment. After my switch to a reseller, my skills developped towards bug-chasing and
		   Ethereal/Wireshark has been an invaluable tool for me. I use it on a daily basis.
		
		<p>In february 2006 I wished to be able to filter on the "X-Forwarded-For:" http-header and
		   joined the mailing-lists. First I wanted to ask for that functionality, but then I realised that I
		   might be able to add it myself. Well, one thing led to another and after submitting a few of
		   my own patches, I started working on bug-reports too. Resulting in being invited to the core
		   development team in august 2007.
		
		<p>I live in The Netherlands near Amsterdam and have started the company SYN-bit in February
		   2010. SYN-bit specializes in troubleshooting services for Application Delivery Networks.
		   Analyzing traffic flows to the bit level to solve design flaws, bugs. But also for exploring the
		   best way to optimize application delivery. I also give training and do remote packet capture
		   analysis :-)
		
		<h3>Main development areas</h3>
		
		<p>As I am more a networking person than a programmer, I mainly contribute by solving issues
		   I encounter while working with Wireshark. I also submitted a few enhancements and solved
		   some bugs reported by others. My development skills are growing, but for now I consider
		   myself skilled at looking at what other people have built and improving, reusing and
		   combining things to solve the issues I want to solve.
