		<h2>NLnet Foundation</h2>
		
		<p>The foundation "Stichting NLnet" stimulates network research and development in the
		   domain of Internet technology. NLnet foundation promotes the exchange of electronic
		   information and all that is related or beneficial to that purpose.
		
		<p>The history of NLnet goes back to 1982 when a group of Europeans led by former NLnet
		   director and member of the Internet Hall of Fame Teus Hagen announced the European Unix
		   Network (EUnet) which became the first public wide area network in Europe and the place
		   where internet was introduced to Europe. NLnet also pioneered the worlds first dial-in and
		   ISDN infrastructure with full country coverage. In 1997 all commercial activities were sold
		   to UUnet (now Verizon) and since that time NLnet has focussed on supporting the open
		   internet, and the privacy and security of internet users. NLnet's core business is to support
		   independent organizations and people that contribute to an open information society.
