		<h2>John Sinteur</h2>
		
		<p>Started out in multi-media in the early nineties with some of the first online stores in the
		   Netherlands, the first online supermarket in the Netherlands, and too many CD-ROM
		   projects to count. Moved to KPN for a few years to do the kpn.com architecture, before
		   starting his own company. iPhone apps, Android apps, making a Raspberry Pi check the
		   acidity of a swimming pool whilst receiving airplane locations, and working on medication
		   safety for electronic prescriptions, everything is fair game. Security isnâ€™t a separate subject - it
		   is part of everything.
