		<h3 id=careers-tech_writer>Technical Writer</h3>
		
		<p>Join the world's first not-for-profit computer security consultancy company, and have the flexibility and freedom of a remote, freelancing position.
		
		<p>A Netherlands-based computer security company seeks talented technical
writers to write
penetration testing reports and offer letters. This is a remote
position, so you can be geographically located anywhere in the world, as
long as you have a strong, reliable Internet connection.
		
		<p>Our company provides ethical hacking services to companies to help them
repair any security vulnerabilities in their web environments and
infrastructure. The role of the technical writer is to initially create
offers (Offertes in Dutch) to secure a company’s business. The creation
of these offers rely on excellent writing skills, critical thinking
skills, relative knowledge of technology, strong attention to detail,
and the ability to pull information out of scoping emails and follow
written instructions.
		
		<p>Once an offer is accepted and the penetration test (pentest) is
complete, it is then the technical writer’s job to work in conjunction
with the pentesters to create a detailed report that can be understood
by other techies as well as their less-technically-inclined management.
All of these projects are under deadline, so you must thrive on and take
pride in delivering materials on time.
		
		<p>All of this is done through GitLab and XML templates, sometimes Open
Office.
		
		<p><strong>Essential Skills:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Knowledge of Git is mandatory, as you will be working with remote/local
			    repositories daily, either through Terminal or SourceTree (or similar).
			<li>Native English speakers preferred, but a deep understanding of the
			    language and grammar will work as well.
			<li>Basic knowledge of XML, Open Office
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Other Requirements:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Ability to express yourself effectively and professionally in writing
			<li>Comfort in coordinating with colleagues/team via an online chat portal
			    (RocketChat)
			<li>Possess reasonable organization skills
			<li>Motivated by deadlines
			<li>Strong work ethic
			<li>Reliable and accountable
			<li>Open to critique and willing to make changes as instructed
		</ul>
		
		<p>Respond with your interest in a brief cover letter detailing how you
meet the above requirements. Also include a CV that reflects your
relevant experience and at least 3 writing samples.
		
		<p>This contract position could lead to recurring freelance work.
